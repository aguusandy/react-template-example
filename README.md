# react-template-example

This is a simple kind a "template" for a React app.

I made this website with some of the basic components of React as Link, Routers, and implement a basic redux and some hooks.

The idea of this project is you add everything you need, starting with some components. 

I made the "html pages" with bootstrap, so if you want, you can remove or change as you want.

The website is functional, but if you have contribution you can change the repository or send an email to aguus.andy@protonmail.com
